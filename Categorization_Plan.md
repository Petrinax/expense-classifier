# Personal Finance Management Tool

## Problem Statement:
I have a problem statement. If solved, it'll add a lot of value to people.

Assume I have my savings account in 5 banks. While downloading their bank statements, they all have different table format and different conventions for naming transaction descriptions.

I need a tool that can take in the bank statements in spreadsheet/csv file and generate personal financial reports.

- First it needs to clean up the file as it may contain data other than statement table. And column names can also differ. Final file should have just the table & same column names for same type of fields in all the files. (like 'description'' for the column that provides transaction description in all files)

- Then categorize all its transactions into (Income/Expenses/Self-Transfers) on the basis of amount, date, and description. Also fetch the details like Payment Mode, Transaction ID, Payee, etc.

- Further categorize Income & Expenses into sub-categories provided by the user as input. (e.g., ['Groceries', 'Savings', 'Fuel', 'Healthcare', ...etc]).

- Once it is done, you will have transactions with fields: Date, Account, Amount, Description, Category, Sub-Category, Transaction ID, Payee, Payee Contact/detail.

- After having curated data, generate reports like income statement, balance sheet, cashflow, etc.

- Finally, create a dashboard to visualize spending, saving patterns, expense structure, balance trends, etc.


## Solution:
Your problem statement is both impactful and feasible, given advancements in data processing and visualization tools. Here's how you can systematically approach this problem, breaking it down into phases:

---

**Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Standardization**
- **Input:** CSV/Excel bank statements from various banks.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Data Parsing:** Detect the location of tabular data in the spreadsheet. Use libraries like **pandas** in Python to identify tables.
  - **Column Normalization:**
    - Map varying column names (e.g., *Txn Description*, *Narration*, *Details* â†’ *Description*).
    - Standardize column formats (e.g., date parsing, numeric formatting for amounts).
  - **Output:** A cleaned, standardized table with fields:
    - **Date, Account, Amount, Description, Transaction ID, Payee, Payment Mode, Payee Contact.**

---

**Phase 2: Transaction Categorization**
- **Primary Categorization:**
  - **Income:** Positive credits (e.g., salary, refunds, etc.).
  - **Expenses:** Negative debits (e.g., purchases, bills, etc.).
  - **Self-Transfers:** Internal transactions (based on descriptions, e.g., *NEFT to MyAccount123*).
- **Sub-Categorization:**
  - Allow user-defined categories (e.g., *Groceries*, *Fuel*).
  - Leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to map transaction descriptions to user-defined categories. Tools like **spaCy** or **regex** for pattern matching can help.
  - For ambiguous cases, provide an interface to manually label transactions and refine the algorithm over time.

---

**Phase 3: Report Generation**
- **Income Statement:** Breakdown of income sources and expense types over a period.
- **Balance Sheet:** Current balance across all accounts.
- **Cash Flow:** Visualization of inflow vs. outflow trends over time.
- Use **pandas** for computations and **Jinja2** for generating dynamic reports in formats like PDF/HTML.

---

**Phase 4: Dashboard Creation**
- **Tool Choices:**
  - **Backend:** Python Flask/Django.
  - **Frontend:** React.js, D3.js, or Plotly Dash for interactive charts.
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL/SQLite for storing categorized data.
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Spending Trends:** Monthly/weekly analysis with line or bar charts.
  - **Category Breakdown:** Pie/donut charts for expense categories.
  - **Balance Trends:** Line graphs for balances over time.
  - **Savings vs. Expenses Ratio:** Gauge or bar indicators.

---

**Technology Stack**
- **Language:** Python for backend processing.
- **Libraries:**
  - **pandas**: Data cleaning, transformation.
  - **numpy**: Computation.
  - **spaCy/Regex**: NLP for description parsing.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly**: Visualization.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/SQLite for storing normalized transactions.
- **Frontend:** React.js with Material-UI or TailwindCSS for a modern dashboard.

---

**Implementation Workflow**
1. **Data Standardization Module:**
   - Read CSV/Excel.
   - Identify and extract the tabular portion.
   - Normalize columns and values.
2. **Categorization Module:**
   - Define rules for primary categorization.
   - Train/implement sub-category model based on user-defined inputs.
3. **Report Generator Module:**
   - Generate summary tables and charts.
4. **Dashboard:**
   - Build interactive views for visualizing patterns and trends.

---

**Next Steps:**
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Start with parsing and normalizing files from 2-3 banks.
- **Iterate on Categorization Rules:** Expand based on real transaction samples.
- **Prototype Dashboard:** Include basic visualizations of income vs. expenses.
